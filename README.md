Paper.js â€” The Swiss Army Knife of Vector Graphics Scripting.

Paper.js is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. 
It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality to create 
and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, 
consistent and clean programming interface.
